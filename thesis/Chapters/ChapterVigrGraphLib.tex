\chapter{Vigra Graph Library} \label{ch:vigra_graph_lib}

Vigra \cite{software_vigra} is library for image processing and analysis.
Vigra provides customizable and genric algorithms and datastructures.
Vigra is capable of dealing with multi-dimensional images 
and many algorithms are implemented for arbitrary data types
and dimensions.
Vigra has a wide range of features from simple convolution filters, 
tensor based image processing to machine learning algorithms 
as decision trees.

To simplify the implementation of algorithms for images arbitrary 
dimension, vigra uses a grid graph which is capable of
dealing with any dimension.

Within this thesis we extend the concept graph based image processing
within vigra w.r.t. graphs of any structure.
We put main emphasis on extendability while keeping the usage very simple.


\section{Graph API's}\label{sec:graph_apis}

We strongly belief is is beneficial to use an existing API's for
graphs instead of inventing an own graph API for Vigra.
Coming up with a new API is not straight forward
since one might to think of any future use case this API.
In addition, users became accustomed with existing API's as 
the LEMON or Boost graph API.
Existing algorithms of a particular API can be reused if we stick
to that API.




\subsection{LEMON Graph API's}\label{sec:lemon_graph_apis}
    LEMON \citet{ software_lemon} 
    stand for  ``Library for Efficient Modeling and Optimization in Networks.''.
    It is an open source C++ library with algorithms and data structures 
    related to directed and undirected graphs.
    The extensive usage of templates make this library very flexible.
    While lemon provides a huge set of graph algorithms,
    we are mostly interested in the graph API itself.
    In the following we will give a brief overview of lemons graph 
    API and the related concepts.
    Explaining the complete lemon graph API in detail
    is beyond the scope of this thesis.
    Interested readers are referred to \citet{software_lemon}.
    We will only discuss the API for undirected graphs since any
    graph algorithm we implemented within this thesis
    will work on undirected graphs.

\subsubsection{Graph Items}
    Any undirected graph class fulfilling the lemon API needs to define 
    the following \emph{descriptor} types to represent the graph items.
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item \lstinline{Graph::Edge}
    \item \lstinline{Graph::Arc}
    \item \lstinline{Graph::Node}
    \end{compactitem}
    These \emph{descriptor} should be cheap types which can be copied
    and passed with almost no overhead.
    In addition, descriptor has an unique id
    \footnote{ unique id w.r.t. the item type. 
    Therefore  multiple  nodes cannot have the same id.
    The same holds line for edges and arcs.
    But there might be a node and edge which have the same id}.
    These id's can be accessed via \lstinline{Graph::id(Node)}, \lstinline{Graph::id(Edge)} and \lstinline{Graph::id(Arc)}.
    These id's can not only be dense but also sparse, which is very
    important for an efficient handling of grid graph edge ids.



\subsubsection{Iterators}

    Within lemon a very convenient mechanism is used to iterate over
    nodes, edges and arcs.
    A special constant \lstinline{INVALID} is used to determine if 
    an iterator reached the end.

    \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}\vspace{-0.75cm}\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
    // iterate over nodes
    for(Graph::NodeIt v(g); v!= lemon::INVALID; ++v){/*...*/}

    // iterate over edges
    for(Graph::EdgeIt e(g); e!= lemon::INVALID; ++e){/*...*/}

    // iterate over arcs
    for(Graph::ArcIt a(g); a!= lemon::INVALID; ++a){/*...*/}

    // use arcs to iterate over neighbor nodes
    for(Graph::OutArcIt a(g,n); a!= lemon::INVALID; ++a){
        const Node neighborNode = g.target(a);
        /*...*/
    }
    \end{lstlisting}\end{minipage}\vspace{0.5cm}

    Any iterator is convertible to the corresponding item which
    is iterated without using \lstinline{operator*()}.

\subsubsection{Map Concept}

    In lemon, graph classes store only the structure of the graph itself.
    All addition data for nodes, edges and arcs is stored 
    in \emph{maps}. 
    Any graph has default implementations for graph maps which
    can be accessed in the following way.

    \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}\vspace{-0.75cm}\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
    // edge map (for data as edge weights)
    Graph::EdgeMap<float> edgeMap(g); 

    // read and write data 
    for(Graph::EdgeIt e(g); e!= lemon::INVALID; ++e){
        // read
        const float val = edgeMap[*e];
        // write
        edgeMap[*e] = std::exp(-1.0*a);
    }

    // node map (for node related data as node labelings )
    Graph::NodeMap<usigned int> nodeMap(g);
    for(Graph::NodeIt v(g); v!= lemon::INVALID; ++v){
        // read
        const unsigned int val = nodeMap[*e];
        // write
        nodeMap[*e] = val+1;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}\end{minipage}\vspace{0.5cm}


    Custom maps can be implemented very easy:

    \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}\vspace{-0.75cm}\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
    template<class Graph>
    class ImplicitEdgeMap {
    public:
        typedef typename Graph::Edge Key;
        typedef double Value;
        Value operator[](Key edge) const { 
            Value a;
            /*...*/
            return a;
        }
    };
    \end{lstlisting}\end{minipage}\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection{Adjacency List Graph}

\subsection{Merge Graph}
To implemented structured clustering algorithms (see \cref{???}) we
need a graph which supports the contraction of edges.
Also a mechanism to merge node and edge features is needed.
Experiments suggest that the edge contraction is more expensive
than feature merging an can even be a bottleneck for huge 3D data 
(see \cref{???} ).
Therefore it is crucial to implemented the MergeGraph (MG) very carefully.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{fig/contraction.pdf}
    \caption{ Schematic edge contraction: Node $u$ and $v$ is merged into node $w$.
        Note the gray node $n$ which is connected to $u$ and $v$.
        After the contraction, edges $\{ n,u\}$ and $\{ n,v\}$ are also merged into 
        a single edge $\{ n, w\}$ 
    }

   We propose and implemented the following design:
   \begin{compactitem}
       \item  A base graph is attached to a merge graph  and  a merge graph will
            always ``view'' to
       \item  Union find data structure for nodes
       \item  Union find data structure for edges

\section{Python}

On the python side, we want node-maps,edge-maps and arc-maps to be stored 
as numpy arrays for ??? reasons.:
\begin{compactitem}
    \item Numpy arrays are the standard for storing multidimensional data in python.
    The fast C implementations and a vectorized API of numpy make it very easy to write 
    fast python code within a few lines.
    Virtually any python user will be familiar with the numpy API and therefore it 
    seems to be natural to store graph maps within numpy arrays.
    \item Vigra provides an mechanism to pass numpy arrays to C++.
    Therefore no new mechanism needs to be implemented to transfer graph
    maps from python to C++.
    This will not only simplify writing extension for the new vigra graph api,
    but also it will reduce the glue code since we can use well tested existing
    solutions.
    \item New algorithms might be implemented in pure python with a mix of
    existing numpy functions and new functions provided within vigras graph api.
    As a proof of concept we implemented ??? in pure python with vigras
    fresh graph api in \cref{???}.
\end{compactitem}

On the C++ side, numpy arrays are stored in MultiArrayViews.
Since API of MultiArrayViews \cite{software_vigra_multiarray_api} does
not implemented the API  of LEMON graph maps (e.g. node-maps,edge-maps and arc-maps).
