\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

Within this thesis we proposed
a new solver, the \emph{Cut Glue \& Cut} algorithm, for the multicut objective
based on the move making paradigm.
We conducted experiments on existing 
and new datasets, which we make public available,
and showed that \emph{CGC}
is significantly faster than existing 
algorithms.
Solutions produced by \emph{CGC} are significant
better than solutions of existing  algorithms w.r.t. energy
and quality metrics as variation of information.
To tackle higher order correlation clustering problems,
future work will concentrate on a higher order CGC - algorithm.


Furthermore implemented a library
for graph based image analysis within VIGRA.
We choose a graph API suitable for graph
based image processing.
We implemented a set of graph classes, 
need for image processing application.
On top of that, we implemented 
graph based algorithms, mostly for
segmentation purposes.
The main emphasis of all proposed
implementations is extendability and easy usage.
For all datastructures and
algorithms we provided Python bindings,
to allow for rapid prototyping 
within Python.
The literature on graph based
algorithms is long, and the set of
algorithms is huge.
Within future work we try to implemented
even  more useful algorithms within
VIGRA's graph library proposed within this thesis.
