\section{Design \& Implementation}\label{sec:vigra_graph_lib_impl}


In the following, we will explain the design and 
implementation of the different graph classes and algorithms
implemented within VIGRA's graph library.


The implementation of grid graphs is explained in \cref{sec:graphs_grid_graph}, 
a basic undirected graphs implementation will be discussed in \cref{sec:graphs_adjacency_list_graph}.
The implementation details of the \emph{region adjacency graph} concept will 
be given in  \cref{sec:graphs_rag}.
To implement structured clustering algorithms (see \cref{sec:rw_hc}) we
need a graph which supports the contraction of edges.
Also a mechanism to merge node and edge features is needed.
Within \cref{sec:graphs_merge_graph} we propose  a very flexible graph 
called \emph{merge graph adaptor} which fulfills these requirements.
A generic set of algorithms  is presented 
in \cref{sec:graph_graph_algorithms}.
While the core implementation of any algorithm is in C++,
we provide Python binding to make almost
any algorithm available in Python.
All design choices related to Python will be explained in \cref{sec:graph_lib_python}.





\subsection{Graphs} \label{sec:impl_graphs}

In the following, we will discuss the design and implementation
of VIGRA's graph classes.
An overview of the different classes and their main properties
is given in \cref{tab:graph_classes}.

\caption[VIGRA's graph classes]{ \label{tab:graph_classes}
    An overview of the graph classes implemented in VIGRA.
    For each class the main purpose is showed.
    For node and edge ids we distinguish between dense  and sparse ids.
    Node and edge descriptors which are showed as vectors 
    are implemented as \lstinline{vigra::TinyVector<T,N>}.
    Any other descriptor is implemented as a class holding
    a single scalar, which is identical to the id.
    The letters x,y,z correspond to spatial coordinates, t to a time coordinate
    and n and e enumerate nodes and edges.
    These letters are also the short name for the axis-tags attached to the
    graph (see \cref{sec:graph_lib_python} for details on axis-tags).
}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Grid Graph} \label{sec:graphs_grid_graph}

The grid graph implemented in VIGRA is N-dimensional.
The dimension can be selected with templates, and therefore with zero
overhead.
VIGRA's grid graph can encode directed and undirected grid graphs.
We will  discuss only the undirected case.
Due to the regular structure of a grid graph, it is possible to compute the edges of a given 
node and vice versa on the fly, instead of storing these relations explicitly.
Therefore a grid graph can be implemented with almost zero memory overhead.

\paragraph{Node Descriptor/Id :}
The node descriptor of a grid graph is implemented as a
$N$-dimensional coordinate of the pixel which corresponds to
a particular node. The id of a node is the scan order index
of the corresponding pixel.
As a consequence, node ids of a grid graph are continuous.
\paragraph{Edge Descriptor/Id :}
Edge descriptors are implemented as a $N+1$-dimensional coordinate.
The first $N$ axis correspond to the node which ``owns'' this edge.
The last axis enumerates the edges w.r.t. the owner node.

In a grid graph, all nodes have the same degree, except for nodes
at the border of the image.
This breaks somehow the regularity of grid graphs.
To still have very regular structure, edge ids
are enumerated, as if the graph would be perfectly
regular. Therefore we enumerate some missing edges
at the border and get non-continuous edge ids.
\Cref{fig:grid_graph_ids} illustrates this enumeration.

\caption[Grid Graph Ids]{ \label{fig:grid_graph_ids}
    Ids and descriptors for a 2D Grid graph with 4-neighborhood on a $3x2$ grid.
    The node ids are continuous from $0$ to $5$ and the descriptors
    are showed as subscripts of the ids.
    Node descriptors are 2D pixel coordinates.
    To get the edge ids, we enumerate the edge, but we ignore the fact that nodes at the
    left and upper border do
    not have an upper and left edge.
    To illustrate this, these ``virtual'' edges are shown dotted.
    The ids of the edges correspond to the enumeration.
    As a consequence edge ids are non continuous.    
    In this example, 
    the set of valid edge ids is $\{ 3,4,5,7,8,10,11 \}$.
    Edge descriptors are 3D coordinates, where the first two
    coordinates correspond to the node which owns this edge.
    The third coordinate is the edge number w.r.t. the node.
    The two edges and the node which ``owns'' them are
    shown in the same unique color.

}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Node Map :} An regular N-dimensional image can
be used as node map, and since node descriptors are plain
coordinates, they can be used to access data at a
particular pixel.
This means, no node map needs to be allocated for a given
image, since the image itself can be used as a node map.
The default node map is derived from \lstinline{vigra::MultiArray<DIM,T>}.

\paragraph{Edge Map :} An N+1-dimensional image is
used as edge map.
This image has the same dimension as a node map, but an extra
dimension for the edges.
The first $N$ axes in the edge descriptor are 
used to determine which pixel ``owns'' the edge,
while the last axis selects the edge index w.r.t. the node.
The default edge map is derived from \lstinline{vigra::MultiArray<DIM+1,Multiband<T> >}.

\subsubsection{Adjacency List Graph} \label{sec:graphs_adjacency_list_graph}

The adjacency list graph is a multipurpose graph.
Region adjacency graphs, nearest neighbor graph,
and  any undirected graph with arbitrary structure can 
be encoded with this graph.
Users can add nodes and edges \footnote{Edge and Node deletion is currently
not implemented, but will be available in a future release}.


\paragraph{Node Descriptor/Id :}
The node descriptor is implemented as a simple class
holding a single integer which is the id 
of the node.
Users can explicitly choose the ids of
nodes while adding them to the graph . As a consequence, node ids can 
be sparse and continuous.

\paragraph{Edge Descriptor/Id :}
The edge descriptors are implemented exactly like
node descriptors, but users cannot give
edges explicit ids.
Therefore edge ids are dense, unless
edges are removed from the graph \footnote{Removing edges from the graph is
not yet implemented}.

\paragraph{Node Map, EdgeMap:} 
The node and edge maps are derived from \lstinline{vigra::MultiArray<1,T>}.
Their size is equal to \lstinline{maxNodeId()+1} and  \lstinline{maxEdgeId()+1}.
The ids and the descriptors can be used to index node and edge maps.


%\paragraph{Usage :}
%    \begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
%    typedef vigra::AdjacencyListGraph Graph;
%    Graph g;
%
%    // add nodes 
%    // - automatic id
%    // - explicit id
%    Graph::Node n0 = g.addNode() 
%    Graph::Node n3 = g.addNode(3)
%
%    // add edges from existing nodes
%    // and new nodes
%    // no parallel edges 
%    Graph::Edge e0 = g.addEdge(n0,n1)
%    Graph::Edge e1 = g.addEdge(2,3)
%    Graph::Edge e2 = g.addEdge(2,3)
%    assert(e1==e2)  
%    \end{lstlisting}
%
%    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
%    g=vigra.graphs.listGraph();
%    # add nodes 
%    # - automatic id
%    # - explicit id
%    n0 = g.addNode() 
%    n3 = g.addNode(3)
%
%    # add edges from existing nodes
%    # and new nodes
%    # no parallel edges 
%    e0 = g.addEdge(n0,n1)
%    e1 = g.addEdge(2,3)
%    e2 = g.addEdge(2,3)
%    assert e1==e2  
%\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Region Adjacency Graph} \label{sec:graphs_rag}

A region adjacency is always defined w.r.t. a labeled base graph.
Instead of implementing a new graph for RAG, we use
the \emph{adjacency list graph} to encode a RAG.
A free function, \lstinline[language=c++]{makeRegionAdjacenyGraph} 
is used to generate the RAG from a given labeling.
The mapping from base graph nodes to RAG nodes  is defined
by the labeling itself. Therefore
the labeling defines a forward mapping from base graph nodes
to RAG Node ids.
Edges in the RAG are mapped to multiple edges in the base graph
via a backward mapping.
This is implemented as an edge map of RAG with
\lstinline[language=c++]{std::vector<BaseGraphEdge>} as value type.
The backward mapping of edges is returned by \lstinline[language=c++]{makeRegionAdjacenyGraph}.
Since the ids of the region adjacency graph can be 
sparse, the labeling of the base graph does not need to be dense
\footnote{Also disjoint labeling are allowed}.



\subsubsection{Merge Graph} \label{sec:graphs_merge_graph}

To implement structured clustering algorithms (see \cref{sec:rw_hc}), 
a graph which supports edge contraction and feature merging is needed.
Some graphs within the LEMON library support 
edge contraction, but this is not part of LEMON's undirected graph concept \footnote{
Edge contraction cannot be a part of LEMON's undirected graph concept, since some graphs
are not mutable (\eg a grid graph)}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{fig/contraction.pdf}

    \addtocontents{lof}{%
        \vspace{1cm}
        \protect\centerline{%
            \protect\includegraphics[width=\lofthumbsize,height=\lofthumbsize,keepaspectratio=true]{fig/contraction.pdf} 
        } 

    }%
    \caption[Schematic edge contraction]{ Schematic edge contraction: Node $u$ and $v$ are merged into node $w$.
        Note the gray node $n$ which is connected to $u$ and $v$.
        After the contraction, edges $\{ n,u\}$ and $\{ n,v\}$ are also merged into 
        a single edge $\{ n, w\}$.
        The picture has been taken from \citep{wiki_edge_contraction} and has been modified slightly.
    }
    \label{fig:e_contract}
\end{figure}


Furthermore LEMON does not define any concept for feature merging, which
is crucial for image processing application \citep{arbelaez_2006_cvpr}.
As a consequence, we define a new concept / API for 
edge contraction and feature merging within the philosophy of LEMON.

We implemented the \emph{merge graph} as a LEMON  \href{http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/doc/latest/a00592.html}{graph adaptor}
\footnote{ LEMON Graph Adaptor: \url{http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/doc/latest/a00592.html} }.
A graph adaptor is always a view to a base graph and cannot exist without one.
A subgraph adaptor can be used to get a view to a subgraph w.r.t. the base graph, without
the need to reallocate the complete subgraph.
In a similar manner, we implement a \emph{merge graph adaptor}.

Each node and edge in the merge graph adaptor corresponds to a connected component of 
edges and nodes in the base graph.
Two union find data structure (UFD), an edge and node UDF encode these connected components.

Feature merging is done via \emph{callbacks} which can be registered to the merge graph adaptor.
The \emph{callback API} is explained in detail below. 


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.65,transform shape]
        \umlclass[template=Graph]{MergeGraphAdpator}
        {
            - edgeUfd               : IterablePartiton          \\
            - nodeUfd               : IterablePartiton          \\ 
            - nodesAdjacency        : AdjacencySetVector        \\

        }

                $\ldots$                                        \\

            + graph()                       : Graph             \\
        } 
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}\caption[Merge Graph Adaptor class diagram]{ \label{fig:cls_mga}

    undirected graph concept are listed. 
    See \cref{fig:uml_lemon_graph_concepts} for all missing 
    members.
}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Node Descriptor/Id :}
The node descriptor is implemented as a simple class
holding a single integer which is the id 
of the node.
Each node in the merge graph encodes a connected
component of nodes in the base graph.
If no edge has been contracted, the node ids
of the merge graph are identical with the ids 
of the base graph.
The contraction of a single edge will invalidate
one node id, since two nodes are merged into a single 
node.
The connected component membership of base graph
nodes is stored in a union find data structure 
and can be accessed via \lstinline{MergeGraph::reprNode(const BaseGraphNode & baseGraphNode)}.


\paragraph{Edge Descriptor/Id :}
Edge descriptors are implemented in the same fashion as node descriptors.
The contraction of a single edge will invalidate
at least one edge id, since the contracted edge is removed
from the graph.
But contracting a single edge can lead to an
unbounded number of parallel edges / multi edges (see \cref{fig:e_contract}).
Multiple edges between a pair of nodes will be merged
into single edges.
The connected component membership of base graph
edges is stored in a union find data structure 
and can be accessed via \lstinline{MergeGraph::reprEdge(const BaseGraphEdge & baseGraphEdge)}.
This is only defined if $u,v$-nodes of this edge are in different connected components.



\paragraph{Node Map, EdgeMap :} 
The node and edge maps are derived from \lstinline{vigra::MultiArray<1,T>}.
Their size is equal to \lstinline{maxNodeId()+1} and  \lstinline{maxEdgeId()+1}.
The id and the descriptors can be used to index node and edge maps.
The implementation is exactly the same as for the AdjacencyListGraph ( see \cref{sec:graphs_adjacency_list_graph}).
The default implementation of node and edge maps does not perform 
any feature merging since the merging strategy depends on the
features and the application itself.
To perform feature merging, the merge graph uses a callback API which is explained below.


\paragraph{Callback API :}

To merge features, the merge graph uses three different callbacks types.
Any of these callbacks is implemented within BOOST's API for callbacks \citep{ boost_function}
\footnote{
Currently we use the BOOST implementation for callbacks, but 
in the future we might use a faster implementation with the same API  \citep{code_project_function}.
}.


\begin{compactitem}
\item Merge node callback :
    A contraction of an edge merges the two nodes of the edge
    into a single node.
    To merge node features, a callbacks with the following signature 
    can be registered to the merge node callback vector.
    \\
    \lstinline[language=c++]{void mergeNodeSignature(const Node & anchorNode,const Node & deadNode);}
    \\
    The first argument is the anchor node, therefore the id and descriptor of
    \lstinline{anchorNode} are still  valid after the contraction, while
    the  id and descriptor of \lstinline{deadNode} become invalid.


\item Merge edge callback :
    A single edge contraction can lead to multiple parallel edges
    which will be merged into single edges.
    To merge features attached to edges, a callback vector
    similar to the node callback vectors exists.
    The signature is the same as for node callbacks, only with 
    edge descriptors.
    \\
    \lstinline[language=c++]{void mergeEdgeSignature(const Edge & anchorEdge,const Edge & deadEdge);}
    \\
    Again, the first argument is the anchor, for which the id and descriptor stay valid.
    The id and descriptor of the second argument become invalid after the merge.

\item Erase edge callback :
    The edge which is contracted is removed from the graph.
    This callback can be used to inform data structures 
    that this edge has been removed.
    \\
    \lstinline[language=c++]{void eraseEdgeSignature(const Edge & edge);}
    \\
    Furthermore, this callback is called at the end of each
    edge contraction, therefore this callback can be used
    to indicate that all callbacks have been called and
    the contraction is finished.

\end{compactitem}





   





\subsection{Graph Algorithms} \label{sec:graph_graph_algorithms}
    
    Within this thesis we implemented the following algorithms:
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item Edge weighted watersheds and 
    \item node weighted watersheds,
    \item Felzenszwalbs method \cite{felzenszwalb_2004_ijcv}
    \item bilateral graph filters, shortest path algorithms
    as \item Dijkstra and \item AStar,
    \item hierarchical clustering and
    \item the CGC multicut algorithm.
    \end{inparaenum}


    All of these algorithms can operate on any graph implemented within VIGRA.
    Most of these algorithms are  implemented as free functions and are 
    straight forward to use.
    The users are referred to VIGRA's documentation where these
    algorithms are explained and usage examples are given.

    For hierarchical clustering algorithms, we use a non trivial 
    class design, which will be explained in the following section.

        Hierarchical Clustering Class Design:
        The merge graph is used to encode the current graph structure during clustering.
        The user implements a custom class within the ClusterOperatorConcept.
        This \emph{cluster operator} classes are responsible for feature merging, and selecting the edge
        which needs to be contracted.
        The HierarchicalClustering class is used to perform the actual 
        hierarchical clustering and encodes the dendrogram of the clustering.

    }
    \end{figure}

    To implement hierarchical clustering for graphs, 
    we make use of the \emph{MergeGraphAdaptor}, in combination 
    with an \emph{cluster operator}.

    The \emph{cluster operator} is connected to the merge
    graph via callbacks and is responsible for feature
    merging and the selection of the edge which needs to be contracted
    next.
    Any edge contraction in the merge graph will call
    members of a cluster operator to merge node and edge features.
    From these merged features the cluster operator needs
    to find the edge which needs to be contracted next.
    Often this is implemented with a 
    dynamic priority queue \footnote{
        A dynamic priority queue is usually implemented as a min 
        heap.
    } where the edge with minimal weight can be accessed,  and for any edge the weights can be changed
    efficiently.
    \Cref{fig:hc_class_design} shows the class design for hierarchical clustering.
    This design is very flexible, since different merging strategies can be implemented 
    in different cluster operators.
    We encourage users to implemented a custom \emph{cluster operator}
    suitable for their application.


    Nevertheless we provide an implementation of a very flexible cluster operator.
    The class \lstinline{cluster_operators::EdgeWeightNodeFeatures} is 
    a very powerful cluster operator.
    A scalar edge weight, as the gradient magnitude, is attached 
    to the edges, an arbitrary feature vector is attached to the nodes.
    \footnote{The node feature vector could be a RGB-triple or a histogram with many bins.}.
    The total edge weight is a combination of the scalar edge weight
    and the difference between the feature vectors of the two 
    nodes of the edge.
    Distances as showed in \cref{tab:hc_distance_types} can
    be used.
    The \emph{cluster operator} will always select the edge with minimal 
    weight to be contracted next.
    Features are merged w.r.t. weighted arithmetic mean.
    



    \subsubsection{Multicut}
        In contrast to rest of this thesis, the \emph{Cut Glue \& Cut} algorithm
        is not implemented within VIGRA, but within \emph{OpenGM} \citep{andres_2012_opengm_arxiv}.
        To interface with OpenGM, especially with multicut algorithms, we provide
        a set of functions to convert a weighted graph w.r.t. VIGRA's graph api
        into OpenGM compatible data-structures.
        \footnote{
            Currently, functions to interface with OpenGM are only provided
            on the Python side.
        }
