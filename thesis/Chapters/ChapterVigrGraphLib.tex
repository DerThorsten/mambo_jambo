\chapter{VIGRA Graph Library} \label{ch:vigra_graph_lib}

VIGRA \cite{software_vigra,koethe_2000_phd_thesis} is a library for image processing and analysis, 
which provides customizable and generic algorithms and data-structures.
The library is capable of dealing with multi-dimensional images 
and many algorithms are implemented for arbitrary data types
and dimensions.
VIGRA has a wide range of features: simple convolution filters, 
tensor based image processing and machine learning algorithms 
as decision trees.

To simplify the implementation of algorithms for images arbitrary 
dimension, VIGRA uses a grid graph which is capable of
dealing with any dimension.

Within this thesis we extend the concept of graph based image processing
within VIGRA w.r.t. graphs of any structure.
We put main emphasis on extendability while keeping the usage very simple.
