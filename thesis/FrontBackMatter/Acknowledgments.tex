\noindent I like to thank to Bj\"orn Andres for introducing me to the world of image processing 
and for awaken my interest in graphical models and combinatoric optimization.
\noindent Many Thanks to J\"org Kappes and Thorben Kr\"oger  for many hours of fruitful discussing about image segmentation,
graphical models and multicuts.

I like to thank my supervisors, \myProf and \myOtherProf which made this thesis possible.
