\section{Watershed Methods}\label{sec:rw_watershed_methods}

The watershed is a powerful tool for image segmentation and
has been used for this purpose since the work of
\citet{beucher_1979_workshop}.
The literature on watersheds is huge and 
a many definitions and algorithms exist
\citep{vinent_1991_pami,beuchner_1994_waterfall,najman_1994_sp,
roerdink_2000_finf,bertrand_2005_jmiv,cousty_2009_pami,
meyer_2012_corr,meyer_2012_corr2}.
A good overview  of the history of watersheds 
is given in the work of \citet{meyer_2012_corr}.
Recent watershed algorithms are discussed in \citep{meyer_2012_corr2}.

The watershed algorithm can be described with the following  \emph{water flooding} analogy:
A gray-scale  image can be interpreted as height map (see \cref{fig:ws_2d_map}, \cref{fig:ws_2d_map3d}).
The water level is then raised as shown in \crefrange{fig:ws_a}{fig:ws_f}.
A watershed is wherever the water of two adjacent valleys would flow together (see \cref{fig:ws_e}, \cref{fig:ws_f} and \cref{fig:ws_2d_lines}).


An image may be interpreted as a node weighted graph,where the node weights
are given by the pixels gray values.
Watersheds can also be applied to edge weighted graphs, where the nodes are unweighted 
and the edges connecting neighboring nodes encode the height between the pass points of two valleys.
\citet{meyer_2012_corr2} examined the relations between node and edge weighted watersheds, 
and proofed that both can be transformed to each other.

\citet{couprie_2011_pami} proposed the  \emph{power-watershed}  algorithm as a generalization of \citep{ boykov_2001_pami,vinent_1991_pami,najman_1994_sp,roerdink_2000_finf,bertrand_2005_jmiv,sinop_2007_iccv,cousty_2009_pami}.

They define the following model:
\begin{align}\label{eq:power_watershed}
\min_x \sum_{e_{ij} \in E}  w_{ip}^p |x_i-x_j|^q + \sum_{v_i } w_{Fi}^p |x_i|^q + \sum_{v_i } w_{Bi}^p |x_i-1|^q \\
s.t. \hspace{0.35cm} x(F)=1, \hspace{0.5cm} x(B)=0
\end{align}

Where $w_{ip}$ are edge weights and $w_{Fi}^p$ and $w_{Bi}^p$ are unary weights
for foreground and background.

Setting $p$ to 1 will lead to the method proposed by \citet{sinop_2007_iccv}.
\Citet{allene_icv_2010} pointed out, when $p=1$ and $q \rightarrow \infty$, solving
\cref{eq:power_watershed} is equivalent to applying a minimum spanning forest algorithm.
\Cref{tab:power_ws} gives an overview how different choices $p$ and $q$ lead
to different well known segmentation methods, and to the new method, named \emph{power watershed}.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
    \backslashbox{$q$}{$p$}        & 0                              & finite & $\infty$              \\ \hline
    $1$           & -      & Graph cuts        & Power watershed           \\ \hline

    $\infty$    & L$1$ norm Voronoi           & L1 norm Voronoi   & Shortest Path Forest      \\ \hline 
    \end{tabular}

A drawback of the watershed method is water leaking trough small ``holes'' in the height map/gradient image.
To overcome this weakness, 
\citet{meyer_2002_moprh}  proposed a flooding scheme with viscous mercury-like
liquids.
This idea has been generalized to different viscous fluids in \citep{vachier_2005_jmiv}. 



\citet{straehle_2011_miccai} proposed a watershed-based method for interactive segmentation
of neuro data.
They show how a background prior can be  integrated efficiently into watersheds,
and that such a prior is beneficial for the segmentation of neuro data.
In addition, \citet{straehle_2012_cvpr} proposed an uncertainty estimator for
guided interactive segmentation based on watersheds.

\label{sec:rw_waterfall}

Edge and node weighted watersheds on graphs can be applied recursively, since
the result of a watershed transformation itself is a more ``coarser'' graph.
This leads to a hierarchy of nested segmentations.
This transformation is called \emph{waterfall transformation} \cite{beuchner_1994_waterfall} and
the hierarchy is called \emph{waterfall hierarchy}.

\Citet{najman_1994_sp} showed, that there is a
strong connection between any hierarchical segmentations
and watersheds.
They prove that there exists a bijection between
the set of ultrametric watersheds \citep{najman_2010_corr} and the set of hierarchical segmentations.
